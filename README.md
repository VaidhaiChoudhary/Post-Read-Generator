## Project Description

The AI Report Generator Agent is an advanced Streamlit-based application designed to automate the creation of comprehensive technical reports. Leveraging powerful AI models and APIs, this tool generates well-structured, insightful reports from a user-provided topic by performing intelligent query generation, web search, and content synthesis.

## Features

- **Automated Query Generation**: Generates diverse and relevant search queries based on the input topic.
- **Asynchronous Web Search**: Performs concurrent web searches using the Tavily API to gather up-to-date information.
- **AI-Powered Report Generation**: Synthesizes search results into a concise, well-organized report with sections including introduction, real-world applications, and industry case studies.
- **Markdown to DOCX Conversion**: Converts the generated markdown report into a downloadable DOCX file.
- **Multi-Model Support**: Supports ChatGroq LLaMA-70B and OpenAI GPT-4o models for flexible report generation.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Streamlit-based UI with API key management, model selection, and report download functionality.

## Installation
